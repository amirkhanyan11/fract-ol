## 🌟 Features  

### 🌀 Fractal Rendering  
- **Mandelbrot Set**: Dive into the infinite complexity of the Mandelbrot fractal. 🌐  
- **Julia Set**: Generate and explore various Julia sets by passing custom parameters. 🎨  

### 🎮 Dynamic Interactions  
- **Zooming**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom infinitely (within computational limits). 🔍  
- **Smooth Graphics**: Handles window events like minimization and switching without disruption. 🚀  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Define fractal types and other options via command-line arguments. 🛠️  

### 🌈 Stunning Visuals  
- **Color Depth**: Each fractal showcases unique depth through vivid color schemes. 🎆  
- **Psychedelic Effects**: Unlock visual brilliance with customizable and dynamic color effects. ✨  

### 🎯 Seamless Controls  
- **ESC Key**: Cleanly exits the program. ❌  
- **Window Close Button**: Properly shuts down the program when the window is closed. 🖼️
